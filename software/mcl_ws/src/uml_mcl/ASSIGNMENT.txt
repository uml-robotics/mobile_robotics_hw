Assignment #6

For assignment #6, you need to write a program that will 
 
 - Localize the robot in the hallway using MCL.
 - Drive the robot to the position directly between the two red X's.
 - Once you are there, stop.

To do this, you should only use the following ROS topics:

 - read from /robot/base_scan
 - write to /robot/cmd_vel

You can also read the image file "hallway.png".

In order to use the sample code, you'll have to install a few packages:

   sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-opengl
   
Also, you'll need to build the Python C extension to do raytracing on the image:

   (roscd sample_hw7/src/raycaster && make)
